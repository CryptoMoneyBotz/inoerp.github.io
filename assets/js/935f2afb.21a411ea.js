The ERP systems contain all the required modules for running any small to midsize businesses. The features are very similar to Oracle R12/ Cloud Application and SAP ECC/Hana S/4. It also contains a lightweight CMS which seamlessly integrates with the ERP","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"manufacturing/bill-of-materials":{"id":"manufacturing/bill-of-materials","title":"Bill Of Materials","description":"A bill of materials (BOM) is a list of the raw materials, sub-assemblies, intermediate assemblies, sub-components, parts, and the quantities of each needed to manufacture an end product. In inoERP, BOMs are maintained in a single level and are assigned to Routings/Operations through a work definition. The system allows you to maintain multiple BOMs for the same item to serve different business purposes. Ex: You can maintain separate BOM for Cost Roll-Up/Lead Time Calculation/What-If Analysis/Planning.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"manufacturing/routing":{"id":"manufacturing/routing","title":"Routing","description":"A routing is a list of operations with department and resource details that is required to manufacture a product. In inoERP, routings are maintained in a single level and are assigned to BOMs through a work definition. The system allows you to maintain multiple routings for the same item to serve different business purposes. Ex: You can maintain separate routing for Cost Roll-Up/Lead Time Calculation/What-If Analysis/Planning.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"manufacturing/wip-transaction":{"id":"manufacturing/wip-transaction","title":"Transaction","description":"Manufacturing a product requires components and resources that use the components to build the product. inoERP provides several seeded manufacturing transactions to map and track the physical activities in the system. You can also define your own transaction types, journal profiles, and accounting profiles to map any unique process that is not industry standard.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"manufacturing/work-definition":{"id":"manufacturing/work-definition","title":"Work Definition","description":"A work definition describes the manufacturing process of an item. It consists of operations, materials, and resources defined in BOM and Routings. Thus, a work definition effectively combines a BOM and routing. It simplifies the Work Definition creation process as the user has only to enter the Work Definition while creating a new job. The system defaults all the values from the work definition. If an item consists of several subassemblies, you need to define work definitions for all the subassemblies before starting production.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"manufacturing/work-order":{"id":"manufacturing/work-order","title":"Work Order","description":"Work orders are always created with reference to a work definition. A work definition combines the material requirement, operations, and resource requirement. When work orders are created with reference to a work definition, the system copies all the data from the work definition. The system creates all the work orders in draft status. You can review and modify the work order/routing/bom details of the work order before releasing it.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
