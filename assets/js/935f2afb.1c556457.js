In inoERP, BOMs are maintained in a single level and are assigned to Routings/Operations through a work definition. The system allows you to maintain multiple BOMs for the same item to serve different business purposes. Ex: You can maintain separate BOM for Cost Roll-Up/Lead Time Calculation/What-If Analysis/Planning.","sidebar":"mySidebar"},"manufacturing/routing":{"id":"manufacturing/routing","title":"Routing","description":"A routing is a list of operations with department and resource details that is required to manufacture a product.

If an item consists of several subassemblies, you need to define work definitions for all the subassemblies before starting production.","sidebar":"mySidebar"},"manufacturing/work-order":{"id":"manufacturing/work-order","title":"Work Order","description":"Work orders are always created with reference to a work definition. A work definition combines the material requirement, operations, and resource requirement. When work orders are created with reference to a work definition, the system copies all the data from the work definition. The system creates all the work orders in draft status. You can review and modify the work order/routing/bom details of the work order before releasing it.","sidebar":"mySidebar"},"privacy":{"id":"privacy","title":"Privacy","description":"Privacy Policy","sidebar":"mySidebar"},"purchasing/configuration":{"id":"purchasing/configuration","title":"Configuration","description":"Use the purchasing configurations to manage all aspects of your purchasing processes.
