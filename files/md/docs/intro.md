## Dynamic pull System
------------
The idea behind inoERP is to provide a dynamic pull-based system where the demand /supply changes frequently and traditional planning systems (such as MRP or Kanban) are incompetent to provide a good inventory turn.

A dynamic pull system is an advanced version of a pull system that encompasses the best feature of the traditional pull system & MRP. The major disadvantage of the conventional Kanban system is the fixed Kanban size and requirement of at least two bins for the entire operation. In a sudden demand decrease, the Kanban system can result in extra inventory, and the value of unused inventory can go up to 2 bin size. Similarly, In case of unexpected demand increases can result in a line down, and the issue will be severe if the lead times are not short.

The dynamic pull system overcomes this issue by recalculating the bucket size (Kanban size/lot size) before creating any supply (requisitions/purchase order/work order). Each time a new supply is created, the system automatically decides the best supply size per the actual demand.
